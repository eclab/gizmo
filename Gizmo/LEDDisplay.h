//// INTRODUCTION
////
//// This library is designed to do write various graphics to a single 8x8 LED matrix
//// or to two 8x8 matrices arranged horizontally.  Unlike existing libraries (such as
//// Adafruit's otherwise cutely-designed AdafruitGFX package), this library is meant
//// to do so RAPIDLY.



///// WHAT TYPE OF SCREEN ARE WE USING?

#define SCREEN_TYPE_ADAFRUIT_16x8_BACKPACK
// #define SCREEN_TYPE_ADAFRUIT_16x8_FEATHERWING_BACKPACK

// We no longer support the following two options, though we have some gunk in the cpp file
// regarding them.
//#define SCREEN_TYPE_ADAFRUIT_8x8_BACKPACK
//#define SCREEN_TYPE_SPARKFUN_8x8_KIT


///// SHOULD WE ROTATE THE ENTIRE 16x8 SCREEN 180 DEGREES?
///// (For example, the screen is installed upside down)

//// FIXED WIDTH GLYPHS
////
//// Fixed with glyphs come in 5 widths: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
////
//// These glyphs are used as follows:
////
//// WIDTH 2:   1 2 3 5 C E F L S ( )
//// 1 is its standard form.  2, 3, 5, C, E, F, L, S are "skinny" versions useful for
//// squeezing into a tighter space.  The parentheses ( and ) are the standard forms
//// of these characters.
////
//// WIDTH 3:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
////            MINUS FLAT(b) UP DOWN UPDOWN
//// The numbers 0...9 an letters A...F are standard forms when used in numerical
//// or hex form.  We include 1 to make it easy to use in combinations with the other
//// numbers.  The letters A...Z are narrow 3x5 versions of these letters, such that four
//// can be placed in a 16x5 row.  We also use these letters for scrolling, except for 
//// M N Q V W, which are basically unreadable 3x5, and so we use width 5 versions of 
//// those instead. We also have MINUS (-) and FLAT (b), as well as up, down, and up-down
//// arrows.
////
//// WIDTH 4:   10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9
//// 10...19 are "squished" versions of these numbers intended to fit in the far left
//// columns of a number.  For example, on an 8x8 display, we can use 12 plus 7 to make
//// 127.  On a 16x8 display, we could use 16 plus 355 to make 16355. The numbers -1...-9
//// are also "squished" versions of these numbers, again intended to fit in the far left
//// columns of a number.  For example, on an 8x8 display, we can use -4 plus 5 to make -45.
//// On a 16x8 display we can use -7 plus 925 to make -7925.
////
//// WIDTH 5: M N Q V W
//// These five letters look terrible in 3x5, so we have 5x5 versions of them which look good.
//// We use these particularly in scrolling.
////
//// WIDTH 8:   EIGHTH TRIPLET (1/96 note), QUARTER TRIPLET (1/48 note), THIRTY-SECOND NOTE, 
////            HALF TRIPLET (1/24 note), SIXTEENTH NOTE, TRIPLET (1/12 note), EIGHTH NOTE, 
////            QUARTER NOTE, QUARTER NOTE TIED TO TRIPLET, DOTTED QUARTER NOTE, HALF NOTE,
////            HALF NOTE TIED TO TWO TRIPLETS, DOTTED HALF NOTE, WHOLE NOTE, DOTTED WHOLE NOTE,
////            DOUBLE WHOLE NOTE, INFINITY, 1/8, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2
////
//// We provide 16 different kinds of note symbols.  We also provide the infinity symbol,
//// plus five common fractions.
