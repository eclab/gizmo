// for me to grep for global variables.
#define GLOBAL

// If this is set, then gizmo will start up in bypass mode initially, AND
// every time you leave the toplevel menu and enter an application, gizmo
// will always exit bypass mode even if you had manually set it.
//
// If this is UNSET, then gizmo will not start up in bypass mode initially,
// and will not toy with bypass mode at all in the toplevel -- it stays as you set it.

// If you don't want to use the SparkFun MIDI Shield, and perhaps use some other
// compatible MIDI shield without the buttons and pots, you can turn on these defines.
// Don't turn BOTH of them on at the same time!
//
// IF you turn on this define and then run the code on the Arduino, it will reset the options,
// display the splash screen, then display RSET and nothing else.  This makes it possible to do
// a reset without holding the three buttons down (because you may have no buttons!) 
//#define HEADLESS_RESET
//
// If you turn on this define, Gizmo will eliminate the option of OFF for its MIDI Control so you
// can't possibly lock yourself out by accident.  You can then control Gizmo entirely via NRPN
// without ever touching the knobs or buttons (which you might not have).
//#define HEADLESS



/////// SETTABLE APPLICATIONS AND FEATURES
///
/// The following applications, options, and additional features can be turned on or off depending
/// on your space needs.  However in order to modify the applications and options you will ALSO need
/// to modify certain menu arrays so they match properly.


// -- APPLICATIONS --
// Note that if you include or exclude certain of these you must also take care to set up the menuItems array
// correctly in STATE_ROOT (see roughly lines 1023--1029 of TopLevel.cpp)
// 
// INCLUDE_ARPEGGIATOR				Include the "basic" Arpeggiator application (the one which appears in the Uno)
// INCLUDE_STEP_SEQUENCER			Include the "basic" Step Sequencer application (the one which appears in the Uno)
// INCLUDE_RECORDER					Include the "basic" note recorder application (the one which appears in the Uno)
// INCLUDE_GAUGE					Include the "basic" MIDI Gauge application
// INCLUDE_CONTROLLER				Include the "basic" Controller application (the one which appears in the Uno)
// INCLUDE_SPLIT					Include the Keyboard Split application
// INCLUDE_THRU						Include the Thru application
// INCLUDE_MEASURE					Include the Measure Counter application


// -- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --
// INCLUDE_MEGA_POTS						Use the more convenient pots A14 and A15 instead of pots A2 and A3 as the "extra" pots in the Controller
// INCLUDE_SEND_NULL_RPN					Should we terminate NRPN/RPN messages with two additional CCs?  Better but slower.
// INCLUDE_EXTENDED_FONT					[In development] Should the extended font be made available?  This currently consists of some extra LFO wave shapes that are unused.  So don't turn this on.
// INCLUDE_CONTROL_BY_NOTE					[In development] Should we allow control of Gizmo by playing notes on the Control channel?
// INCLUDE_STEP_SEQUENCER_CC_MUTE_TOGGLES	[In development] Should we toggle mutes in the step sequencer?

// -- OPTIONS --
// USE_ALL_NOTES_OFF						These define how Gizmo kills all sounds.  The Blofeld's Arpeggiated sounds do not respond properly 
// USE_ALL_SOUNDS_OFF						to All Notes Off.  But other hardware, such as the Kawai K4, doesn't properly respond to ALL Sounds 
//											Off.  :-(  You can set one, or both, of these.
